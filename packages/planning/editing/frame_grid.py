"""Single 30fps frame grid: the one source of truth for timeline boundary quantization.

Ported faithfully from digital-human-Cutagent editing_agent/frame_grid.py. The
production bug this guards against: planned boundaries (e.g. 12.96s) that are not on
the 30fps grid cause downstream trim (concat / render) to pick a frame one short or
one long, and the rounding error accumulates along the timeline until adjacent
segments overlap or duplicate a frame at the junction (the seam flashes one frame).

Fix: at plan time every boundary is quantized ONCE onto a single 30fps frame grid,
and all slicing is by integer frame index so each window is exactly ``B - A`` frames
and adjacent windows are exactly contiguous (window i ends on the same frame index
that window i+1 starts on — zero overlap, zero gap, zero duplicated frame).

``TIMELINE_FPS`` is hard-wired to 30 (not configurable): the physical render rate is
fixed at 30 across the whole chain, so a configurable plan grid would only create a
new "plan grid != physical fps" mismatch surface. This module is zero-dependency
(pure functions) so any downstream slicer can import it safely.
