"""Regression: a failed complete() cleans up server-written derived objects.

normalize/stabilize each write a fresh object via store_file before a later step
may fail. The original _fail_upload only dropped the browser-written staging
object, leaking the normalized/stabilized derivative. This drives normalize to
succeed (writing a media-normalized object) and then forces stabilize to fail, and
asserts the derived object is gone after the failure.
