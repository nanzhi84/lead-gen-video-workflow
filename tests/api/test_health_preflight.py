    """#66 regression: the fail-closed preflight must run BEFORE bootstrap seeds
    the local admin/viewer.

    The original API lifespan called ``bootstrap_sqlalchemy_storage_if_enabled()``
    (which seeds usr_admin/usr_viewer with dev-default credentials when
    ``seed_local_auth`` is on) *before* ``validate_startup_settings``. On an unsafe
    production deploy that meant the hardcoded admin was written into the prod DB
    and only *then* did startup refuse to serve — the credentials lingered. #87 B4
    moved the gate even earlier, into ``create_app()`` construction itself: the
    preflight now runs and fails closed before configure_app_state/lifespan, so
    bootstrap (which lives in the lifespan) never gets the chance to seed. This
    asserts that construction-time ordering invariant — preflight ran, bootstrap
    did not — which is strictly stronger than the original lifespan-time guard.
