"""Canonical node graph for the digital_human production workflows.

Kept dependency-free so progress / UI / reporting code can read the *expected*
node count, the node order, and the dependency edges for a template without
importing the heavy pipeline engine (ffmpeg, providers, every node handler).
``digital_human.py`` re-exports ``NODE_SEQUENCE`` from here so there is a single
source of truth.

Each workflow is a dependency DAG (``WORKFLOW_GRAPHS``): nodes plus the edges that
say which upstream node must finish before a node may run. The three shipping
templates are linear chains (edge i -> i+1), so their behaviour is unchanged, but
the runtime schedules from the *edges* via ``topological_node_order`` — a
dependency ready-set, not a hard-coded list — so a non-linear template runs its
independent nodes in a valid dependency order. ``ready_nodes`` exposes the set of
nodes whose upstreams are all complete (the seam a future parallel scheduler fills;
#137).
