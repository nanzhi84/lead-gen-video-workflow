# Maintenance: deep repository hygiene cleanup

## PR Title

Maintenance: deep repository hygiene cleanup

## Executive Summary

This PR performs a behavior-preserving deep hygiene pass across the repo. It fixes stale docs/config references, resolves baseline lint failures, deletes obsolete frontend wrappers and contract probe files, removes production-unused frontend exports, consolidates duplicate runtime helpers, completes Settings/env sample coverage, cleans static-dead test parameters, and records the audit/validation trail.

The aggressive second pass intentionally added a few small canonical helpers, but removed substantially more repeated implementation: tracked changes after that pass were roughly `+166/-1215`, with four new helper files totaling 333 lines.

## Docs Updated

- Added `docs/repo-cleanup-log.md`, `docs/repo-cleanup-inventory.md`, and this PR body.
- Updated stale Alembic migration range references.
- Corrected root child-guide naming from `AGENTS.md` to `CLAUDE.md`.
- Fixed README's nonexistent router reference, stale `dev_up.sh` web port, and storage backend enum drift.
- Clarified `.env.example` direct runtime env switches.
- Completed `.env.example` coverage for every env var read by `Settings` and added a contract guard to keep it covered.
- Updated roadmap worktree guidance for Codex vs Claude worktree locations.
- Removed README test-env duplication by referring to the manual setup block.
- Removed stale `apps/web/CLAUDE.md` references to deleted typecheck probes.

## Validation Commands Run

- `uv run --extra dev ruff check .`
- `git diff --check`
- `env -u ALL_PROXY -u all_proxy -u HTTP_PROXY -u HTTPS_PROXY -u http_proxy -u https_proxy uv run --extra dev python -m pytest -q`
- `env -u ALL_PROXY -u all_proxy -u HTTP_PROXY -u HTTPS_PROXY -u http_proxy -u https_proxy uv run --extra dev python scripts/export_openapi.py`
- `(cd apps/web && npm run generate:api)`
- `git diff --exit-code -- apps/web/src/api/openapi.json apps/web/src/api/schema.d.ts`
- `(cd apps/web && npx --yes knip --production --reporter compact && npx tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit --noUnusedLocals --noUnusedParameters && npm run build)`
- `uvx --from vulture vulture apps packages scripts tests --min-confidence 90 --exclude 'apps/web/node_modules,apps/web/dist,.venv'`
- `bash -c 'set -euo pipefail; set -a; source .env.example; set +a; test "$CUTAGENT_STORAGE_BACKEND" = sqlalchemy; test "$CUTAGENT_PUBLISH_ADAPTER" = xiaovmao.cdp'`
- Settings/env comparison script confirming no `Settings` env vars are missing from `.env.example`.
- Targeted Python suites for imports, mappers, BGM/loudness, timeline/export nodes, digital-human runtime, workflow reuse, and frontend probes.
- DB integration tests on clean temporary database `cutagent_ci_cleanup_8e2d`.
- Temporal tests against the same clean DB plus shared MinIO durable/ephemeral buckets.
- Runtime source duplicate scan with `jscpd --min-lines 20 --min-tokens 120`, excluding docs/tests/generated/migrations.

## Tests Passing

- Default pytest suite.
- Python lint.
- Frontend `knip --production`.
- Frontend TypeScript unused-symbol gate.
- Frontend production build.
- OpenAPI and generated TypeScript schema drift checks.
- Settings/env coverage contract tests.
- Full high-confidence vulture dead-symbol scan.
- DB integration tests on a clean temporary database.
- Temporal integration tests with shared MinIO durable + ephemeral buckets.

## Known Preexisting Failures

- Baseline `ruff check .` failed before cleanup edits on E402/E702 findings; this PR fixes those failures.
- Direct `scripts/ci_gate.sh` is blocked on this macOS host because GNU `timeout`/`gtimeout` is unavailable; equivalent subcommands were run manually.
- Integration against the existing local dev DB failed because local auth seed state is dirty; the same suite passed on a fresh temporary DB.

## Risks and Mitigations

- Migrations, generated clients, Temporal registration, provider registries, seed scripts, fixtures, manual DB/OSS scripts, and deployment hooks were treated as high-risk and left untouched unless direct evidence supported a safe change.
- The removed frontend typecheck probes had no package/CI/import references and were covered by `tsc`, frontend build, `knip`, and full pytest.
- The `export:openapi` package script is retained despite `knip` reporting `python` as an unlisted binary, because it is the documented frontend contract-regeneration entrypoint.
- Mapper/helper consolidations were validated with targeted mapper/import/media/workflow tests plus full pytest.
- A first full pytest caught an unsafe `defaultForm` export deletion; the test now uses the public `loadStoredForm()` entry and the full suite passes.

## Reviewer Checklist

- [ ] Confirm deleted files have evidence in `docs/repo-cleanup-log.md`.
- [ ] Confirm consolidations preserve behavior and have targeted validation.
- [ ] Confirm generated API files have no drift.
- [ ] Confirm high-risk dynamic surfaces were not speculatively deleted.
- [ ] Confirm final rescan found no new high-confidence runtime cleanup candidates.
